## Quiz 37-39

### Quiz 37

### Quiz 38

Data structure alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. In C, a low level PL, a structure creates packs of one size.

It takes the biggest size of object to be stored and chooses that to be the size of each pack. 

Each pack will take up that much memory even if the pack is not full. Then it takes objects in order and groups them into packs.

This structure has 5 different data, the size of each one of them is:

1 2 8 2 4

Now we have to group the value to put them in a pack of 8 byte (8 is the biggest value in the list)

1+2, 8, 2+4

We have 3 packs of 8 bytes. 

The total memory size (the OUTPUT) is 8*3 = 24 byte

### Quiz 40 
Lily was crossing a thick forest when she realizes that there is a tiger ahead of her who has seen Lily. Lily quickly takes out a matchbox from her bag and burns a 
matchstick, because the tiger is afraid of fire. A matchstick takes 5 seconds to burn completely.
Given that the length of the forest that Lily needs to cross is l meters , and that Lily's speed is s centimeters per second, print the minimum number of 
matchsticks Lily needs to burn to cross the forest safely.

| Input l:int s:int 	| Output:int 	|
|-	|-	|
| 100 100 	| 20 matches 	|
| 250 110 	| 46 matches 	|
| 500 150 	| 67 matches 	|
