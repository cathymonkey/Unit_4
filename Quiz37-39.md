Data structure alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. In C, a low level PL, a structure creates packs of one size.

It takes the biggest size of object to be stored and chooses that to be the size of each pack. 

Each pack will take up that much memory even if the pack is not full. Then it takes objects in order and groups them into packs.

This structure has 5 different data, the size of each one of them is:

1 2 8 2 4

Now we have to group the value to put them in a pack of 8 byte (8 is the biggest value in the list)

1+2, 8, 2+4

We have 3 packs of 8 bytes. 

The total memory size (the OUTPUT) is 8*3 = 24 byte
